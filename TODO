# this is absolutely an MVP that was written as quickly as possible.

for the next iteration, the following features should be added:

* optimize to make less calls to gcutil
* currently calls "get#{subcommand}" once per instance that is being managed.
* it should probably be making one: "list#{subcommand}s" call per project_id

* more properties
* * right now, everything is implemneted as parameters, they should be implemented as
properties so that the values can show up with puppet apply

* implement classification
* * the real power of this implemntation can be demonstrated by implementing
classification

-- can we patch puppet for cert management?
